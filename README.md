# Proxmox_Setup
 
This is a repository containing some of the scripts and tools I use to configure and deploy VM's from within my homelab. Included in this readme are some general notes on how to use the scripts and tools. As well as some resources that I have found useful in the past. If you're interested in using some of these scripts or have any questions please feel free to reach out. Ways to contact me are listed on my github page.
